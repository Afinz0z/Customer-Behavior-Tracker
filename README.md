# CodersCave Data Science Internship Task

Welcome to my submission for the CodersCave Data Science Internship Task. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on transactional data to derive valuable insights into customer preferences, purchasing patterns, and overall behavior.

## About the Project

The project focuses on understanding customer behavior based on transactional data. The provided dataset contains information about transactions, including the quantity, value, product categories, and other attributes.

## Repository Contents

- `transaction_data.csv`: CSV file containing the transactional data.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for EDA.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the `analysis.ipynb` notebook, I performed the following tasks:

1. Loaded the transactional data.
2. Displayed information about the data, including data types and missing values.
3. Computed summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
4. Visualized customer preferences by plotting the most purchased product categories.
5. Explored purchasing patterns by visualizing total sales per month.

## How to Run

To run the analysis notebook in VS Code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Afinz0z/Customer-Behavior-Tracker`
2. Open VS Code and navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook in VS Code.
4. Make sure you have the Jupyter extension installed in VS Code for running notebooks.
5. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and view the results.

## Feedback and Questions

If you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear your thoughts!

## Thank You

Thank you for considering my submission for the CodersCave Data Science Internship Task. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the team and learn from experienced professionals.
